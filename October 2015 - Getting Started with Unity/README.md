#Getting Started
***Covers topics that are expected to be completed before attending the event.*** Things like having software downloaded and/or updated to the most current version unless otherwise specified. Also includes Unity account creation.

##What will be covered in this event?
By the end of this event we expect you to be able to create and setup a basic 2D game that allows for the character to move around the level, collect objects as well as count and keep score of how many have been collected, and import/export assets into the game. This is a very basic tutorial and is a modified version of the ball game tutorial that can be found on Unity's website. They have a great number of resources that are free for all to access. We simply used this version as our "Hello World!" for Unity, but in a way where we can answer any questions that arise as they come about. In future sessions we will be creating custom games.

##Downloading Unity
https://unity3d.com/get-unity -- Download the Free Version *Linux, OS X, or Windows does not matter. We will be using the Windows version for our presentation so any issues facedif not on Windows we cannot promise that we will be able to help.*

##Creating an Account
https://accounts.unity3d.com/sign-up -- Create a Unity Account

##Ensuring You are up to Date
Run Unity on your desktop. Once it loas if running for the first time log into your Unity account when it prompts. Unity should at this point let you know if there are any updates. If it does not then you are in good shape.

##Event Material
Feel free to go over the Sway presentation before the event and get a heads up on what will be covered. We will not expect you to do this, but if you want a chance to do it ahead of time we have no problem with that. In future sessions we would actually encourage it once the material becomes more complex. https://sway.com/QsylrmK9vvTa8Y5V
